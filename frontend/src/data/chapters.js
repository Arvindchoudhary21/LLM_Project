1.1 DIVERSITY IN THE LIVING WORLD

If you look around you will see a large variety of living organisms, be it potted plants, insects, birds, your pets or other animals and plants.

Hence, there is a need to standardise the naming of living organisms such that a particular organism is known by the same name all over the world.

Biologists follow universally accepted principles to provide scientific names to known organisms. Each name has two components – the Generic name and the specific epithet.

1.2 TAXONOMIC CATEGORIES

Classification is not a single step process but involves hierarchy of steps in which each step represents a rank or category.

1.2.1 Species

Taxonomic studies consider a group of individual organisms with fundamental similarities as a species.

1.2.2 Genus

Genus comprises a group of related species which has more characters in common in comparison to species of other genera.

1.2.3 Family

The next category, Family, has a group of related genera with still fewer similarities as compared to genus and species.

1.2.4 Order

Order being a higher category, is the assemblage of families which exhibit a few similar characters.

1.2.5 Class

This category includes related orders. For example, order Primata comprising monkey, gorilla and gibbon is placed in class Mammalia.

1.2.6 Phylum

Classes comprising animals like fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds along with mammals constitute the next higher category called Phylum.

1.2.7 Kingdom

All animals belonging to various phyla are assigned to the highest category called Kingdom Animalia.

SUMMARY

The living world is rich in variety. Millions of plants and animals have been identified and described but a large number still remains unknown.

The gymnosperms are plants in which the ovules are not enclosed by any ovary wall and remain exposed.

3.5 ANGIOSPERMS

In the angiosperms or flowering plants, the pollen grains and ovules are developed in specialised structures called flowers.

SUMMARY

Plant kingdom includes algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms. Algae are chlorophyll-bearing simple, thalloid, autotrophic and largely aquatic organisms... The angiosperms are divided into two classes – the dicotyledons and the monocotyledons.

  title: "Animal Kingdom",
  content: `
Animals are eukaryotic, multicellular and heterotrophic organisms. They have a complex body structure with differentiated tissues. Most animals are capable of locomotion and respond quickly to stimuli. The animal kingdom is broadly classified based on the arrangement of cells, body symmetry, nature of coelom, and presence or absence of segmentation.

4.1 LEVELS OF ORGANISATION

Animals can be classified based on the level of organisation into cellular, tissue, organ, and organ system levels. For example, sponges show cellular level of organisation. Cnidarians show tissue level, while Platyhelminthes and others show organ level. Higher organisms such as annelids and above exhibit organ system level of organisation.

4.2 SYMMETRY

Animals may be asymmetrical (e.g., sponges), radially symmetrical (e.g., cnidarians and ctenophores), or bilaterally symmetrical (e.g., Platyhelminthes to chordates).

4.3 GERM LAYERS

Animals are either diploblastic (having two germ layers: ectoderm and endoderm, as in cnidarians) or triploblastic (having three germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm, as in Platyhelminthes and above).

4.4 COELOM

Based on the presence or absence of body cavity or coelom, animals are acoelomates (no body cavity, e.g., Platyhelminthes), pseudocoelomates (e.g., Aschelminthes), or coelomates (true coelom, e.g., Annelida to Chordata).

4.5 SEGMENTATION

In some animals, the body is externally and internally divided into segments with a serial repetition of at least some organs. This segmentation is called metamerism and is seen in annelids, arthropods, and chordates.

4.6 NOTOCHORD

Notochord is a mesodermally derived rod-like structure formed on the dorsal side during embryonic development in some animals. Animals with notochord are called chordates and those without it are called non-chordates.

4.7 CLASSIFICATION OF ANIMAL KINGDOM

4.7.1 Phylum Porifera

These are commonly known as sponges. They are mostly marine, asymmetrical, or radially symmetrical and have a cellular level of organisation. They have a water transport system, a body with pores (ostia), and an internal cavity (spongocoel). They are hermaphrodites and reproduce sexually and asexually.

4.7.2 Phylum Coelenterata (Cnidaria)

They are radially symmetrical and diploblastic. They have a tissue level of organisation and a central gastrovascular cavity. Examples: Hydra, Jellyfish, Sea anemone.

4.7.3 Phylum Ctenophora

They are marine, radially symmetrical, and diploblastic animals with eight rows of ciliated comb plates for locomotion. Bioluminescence is common in them. Example: Pleurobrachia.

4.7.4 Phylum Platyhelminthes

These are dorsoventrally flattened and bilaterally symmetrical animals. They are triploblastic and acoelomate. They show organ level of organisation. Most are parasitic. Examples: Planaria, Taenia (tapeworm).

4.7.5 Phylum Aschelminthes

These are roundworms. They are bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic, and pseudocoelomate. They show organ-system level of organisation. Examples: Ascaris, Wuchereria.

4.7.6 Phylum Annelida

They are bilaterally symmetrical, segmented, coelomate animals. They show organ-system level of organisation. Closed circulatory system is present. Examples: Earthworm, Leech.

4.7.7 Phylum Arthropoda

They are the largest phylum in the animal kingdom. They are bilaterally symmetrical, segmented, and coelomate. They have jointed appendages and an open circulatory system. Examples: Insects, Crabs, Spiders.

4.7.8 Phylum Mollusca

They are soft-bodied, unsegmented, and coelomate animals. They have a muscular foot, mantle, and a calcareous shell. Examples: Snail, Octopus.

4.7.9 Phylum Echinodermata

They are exclusively marine and have a spiny skin. They are triploblastic and coelomate. They show radial symmetry in adults and bilateral symmetry in larvae. Examples: Starfish, Sea urchin.

4.7.10 Phylum Hemichordata

They have a rudimentary notochord, a dorsal nerve cord, and a pharynx with gill slits. They are marine and bilaterally symmetrical. Example: Balanoglossus.

4.7.11 Phylum Chordata

They have a notochord, dorsal hollow nerve cord, and paired pharyngeal gill slits. They are triploblastic, coelomate, and bilaterally symmetrical. This phylum includes classes such as Pisces, Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves, and Mammalia.

SUMMARY

Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic, and heterotrophic organisms. They show various levels of organisation, symmetry, body cavity, and segmentation. Based on these features, animals are classified into several phyla. Chordates are distinguished by the presence of notochord, a dorsal nerve cord, and pharyngeal slits.

  title: "Morphology of Flowering Plants",
  content: `
The wide range in the structure of higher plants will never fail to fascinate us. Even though the angiosperms show such a large diversity in external structure or morphology, they are all characterised by presence of roots, stems, leaves, flowers and fruits. In chapters 2 and 3, we talked about classification of plants based on morphological and other characteristics. For any successful attempt at classification and at understanding any higher plant (or for that matter any living organism) we need to know standard technical terms and standard definitions. We also need to know about the possible variations in different parts, found as adaptations of the plants to their environment, e.g., adaptions to various habitats, for protection, climbing, storage, etc.

5.1 THE ROOT

In majority of the dicotyledonous plants, the direct elongation of the radicle leads to the formation of primary root which grows inside the soil. It bears lateral roots of several orders that are referred to as secondary, tertiary, etc. roots. The primary roots and its branches constitute the tap root system, as seen in the mustard plant. In monocotyledonous plants, the primary root is short lived and is replaced by a large number of roots. These roots originate from the base of the stem and constitute the fibrous root system, as seen in the wheat plant. In some plants, like grass, Monstera and the banyan tree, roots arise from parts of the plant other than the radicle and are called adventitious roots. The main functions of the root system are absorption of water and minerals from the soil, providing a proper anchorage to the plant parts, storing reserve food material and synthesis of plant growth regulators.

5.1.1 Regions of the Root

The root is covered at the apex by a thimble-like structure called the root cap. It protects the tender apex of the root as it makes its way through the soil. A few millimetres above the root cap is the region of meristematic activity. The cells of this region are very small, thin-walled and with dense protoplasm. They divide repeatedly. The cells proximal to this region undergo rapid elongation and enlargement and are responsible for the growth of the root in length. This region is called the region of elongation. The cells of the elongation zone gradually differentiate and mature. Hence, this zone, proximal to region of elongation, is called the region of maturation. From this region some of the epidermal cells form very fine and delicate, thread-like structures called root hairs. These root hairs absorb water and minerals from the soil.

5.2 THE STEM

The stem is the ascending part of the axis bearing branches, leaves, flowers and fruits. It develops from the plumule of the embryo of a germinating seed. The stem bears nodes and internodes. The region of the stem where leaves are born are called nodes while internodes are the portions between two nodes. The stem bears buds, which may be terminal or axillary. Stem is generally green when young and later often become woody and dark brown. The main function of the stem is spreading out branches bearing leaves, flowers and fruits. It conducts water, minerals and photosynthates. Some stems perform the function of storage of food, support, protection and of vegetative propagation.

5.3 THE LEAF

The leaf is a lateral, generally flattened structure borne on the stem. It develops at the node and bears a bud in its axil. The axillary bud later develops into a branch. Leaves originate from shoot apical meristems and are arranged in an acropetal order. They are the most important vegetative organs for photosynthesis. A typical leaf consists of three main parts: leaf base, petiole and lamina. The leaf is attached to the stem by the leaf base and may bear two lateral small leaf like structures called stipules. In monocotyledons, the leaf base expands into a sheath covering the stem partially or wholly. In some leguminous plants the leafbase may become swollen, which is called the pulvinus. The petiole help hold the blade to light. Long thin flexible petioles allow leaf blades to flutter in wind, thereby cooling the leaf and bringing fresh air to leaf surface. The lamina or the leaf blade is the green expanded part of the leaf with veins and veinlets.

5.3.1 Venation

The arrangement of veins and the veinlets in the lamina of leaf is termed as venation. When the veinlets form a network, the venation is termed as reticulate. When the veins run parallel to each other within a lamina, the venation is termed as parallel. Leaves of dicotyledonous plants generally possess reticulate venation, while parallel venation is the characteristic of most monocotyledons.

5.3.2 Types of Leaves

A leaf is said to be simple, when its lamina is entire or when incised, the incisions do not touch the midrib. When the incisions of the lamina reach up to the midrib breaking it into a number of leaflets, the leaf is called compound. The compound leaves may be of two types. In a pinnately compound leaf a number of leaflets are present on a common axis, the rachis, which represents the midrib of the leaf as in neem. In palmately compound leaves, the leaflets are attached at a common point, i.e., at the tip of petiole, as in silk cotton.

5.3.3 Phyllotaxy

Phyllotaxy is the pattern of arrangement of leaves on the stem or branch. This is usually of three types – alternate, opposite and whorled. In alternate type of phyllotaxy, a single leaf arises at each node in alternate manner, as in china rose, mustard and sunflower plants. In opposite type, a pair of leaves arise at each node and lie opposite to each other as in Calotropis and guava plants. If more than two leaves arise at a node and form a whorl, it is called whorled, as in Alstonia.

5.4 THE INFLORESCENCE

A flower is a modified shoot wherein the shoot apical meristem changes to floral meristem. The arrangement of flowers on the floral axis is termed as inflorescence. Depending on whether the apex gets developed into a flower or continues to grow, two major types of inflorescences are defined – racemose and cymose. In racemose type the main axis continues to grow and flowers are borne in acropetal succession. In cymose type the main axis terminates in a flower and flowers are borne in a basipetal order.

5.5 THE FLOWER

The flower is the reproductive unit in the angiosperms. It is meant for sexual reproduction. A typical flower has four different kinds of whorls – calyx, corolla, androecium and gynoecium. Calyx and corolla are accessory organs, while androecium and gynoecium are reproductive organs. The flower may be actinomorphic or zygomorphic. Based on position of floral parts, flowers are hypogynous, perigynous or epigynous.

5.5.1 Parts of a Flower

5.5.1.1 Calyx: Outermost whorl made of sepals. May be free (polysepalous) or united (gamosepalous).

5.5.1.2 Corolla: Made of petals. Brightly coloured and may be free (polypetalous) or united (gamopetalous). Shows different types of aestivation – valvate, twisted, imbricate or vexillary.

5.5.1.3 Androecium: Male reproductive organ. Composed of stamens. May be free or united. Filaments may be attached to petals (epipetalous) or perianth (epiphyllous).

5.5.1.4 Gynoecium: Female reproductive organ. Made of carpels. A carpel has stigma, style and ovary. Ovary contains ovules. Carpels may be free (apocarpous) or fused (syncarpous). Placentation can be marginal, axile, parietal, basal, free central.

5.6 THE FRUIT

The fruit is a mature ovary developed after fertilisation. It contains seeds. It may be fleshy or dry. Example: drupe in mango and coconut.

5.7 THE SEED

Seeds develop from ovules after fertilisation. A seed has a seed coat and an embryo. Based on number of cotyledons, seeds are of two types.

5.7.1 Structure of a Dicot Seed: Two cotyledons, a seed coat with testa and tegmen, a hilum and micropyle. Cotyledons store food.

5.7.2 Structure of a Monocot Seed: One cotyledon (scutellum), large endosperm, and protective sheaths (coleoptile and coleorhiza).

5.8 SEMI-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF A TYPICAL FLOWERING PLANT

It includes description of habit, vegetative parts and floral characters. Uses floral formula and floral diagram. Example: mustard floral formula is ⊕ K2+2 C4 A2+4 G(2)

5.9 SOLANACEAE

A family commonly called potato family. Flowers are actinomorphic, bisexual. Corolla is united, calyx is united, ovary is bilocular. Economic importance includes tomato, brinjal, chilli, tobacco and medicinal plants.

SUMMARY

Flowering plants exhibit wide variety in form and function. They have root, stem, leaves, flowers and fruits. Leaves show variations in venation, arrangement, and types. Inflorescences show different patterns of flower arrangement. The flower consists of four floral whorls. Fruits and seeds develop after fertilisation. Seeds may be monocot or dicot. A typical flowering plant can be described using standard floral formula and floral diagram.

You can very easily see the structural similarities and variations in the external morphology of the larger living organism, both plants and animals. Similarly, if we were to study the internal structure, one also finds several similarities as well as differences. This chapter introduces you to the internal structure and functional organisation of higher plants. Study of internal structure of plants is called anatomy. Plants have cells as the basic unit, cells are organised into tissues and in turn the tissues are organised into organs. Different organs in a plant show differences in their internal structure. Within angiosperms, the monocots and dicots are also seen to be anatomically different. Internal structures also show adaptations to diverse environments.

6.1 THE TISSUE SYSTEM

On the basis of their structure and location, there are three types of tissue systems. These are the epidermal tissue system, the ground or fundamental tissue system and the vascular or conducting tissue system.

6.1.1 Epidermal Tissue System

The epidermal tissue system forms the outermost covering of the whole plant body and comprises epidermal cells, stomata and the epidermal appendages – the trichomes and hairs. The epidermis is the outermost layer of the primary plant body. It is made up of elongated, compactly arranged cells, which form a continuous layer. Epidermis is usually single layered. Epidermal cells are parenchymatous with a small amount of cytoplasm lining the cell wall and a large vacuole. The outside of the epidermis is often covered with a waxy thick layer called the cuticle which prevents the loss of water. Cuticle is absent in roots. Stomata are structures present in the epidermis of leaves. Stomata regulate the process of transpiration and gaseous exchange. Each stoma is composed of two bean-shaped cells known as guard cells which enclose stomatal pore. In grasses, the guard cells are dumb-bell shaped. The outer walls of guard cells are thin and the inner walls are highly thickened. The guard cells possess chloroplasts and regulate the opening and closing of stomata. Sometimes, a few epidermal cells, in the vicinity of the guard cells become specialised and are known as subsidiary cells. The stomatal aperture, guard cells and the surrounding subsidiary cells are together called stomatal apparatus. The cells of epidermis bear a number of hairs. The root hairs are unicellular elongations of the epidermal cells and help absorb water and minerals from the soil. On the stem the epidermal hairs are called trichomes. The trichomes in the shoot system are usually multicellular. They may be branched or unbranched and soft or stiff. They may even be secretory. The trichomes help in preventing water loss due to transpiration.

6.1.2 The Ground Tissue System

All tissues except epidermis and vascular bundles constitute the ground tissue. It consists of simple tissues such as parenchyma, collenchyma and sclerenchyma. Parenchymatous cells are usually present in cortex, pericycle, pith and medullary rays, in the primary stems and roots. In leaves, the ground tissue consists of thin-walled chloroplast containing cells and is called mesophyll.

6.1.3 The Vascular Tissue System

The vascular system consists of complex tissues, the phloem and the xylem. The xylem and phloem together constitute vascular bundles. In dicotyledonous stems, cambium is present between phloem and xylem. Such vascular bundles possess the ability to form secondary xylem and phloem tissues, and hence are called open vascular bundles. In the monocotyledons, the vascular bundles have no cambium and are referred to as closed. When xylem and phloem within a vascular bundle are arranged in an alternate manner along different radii, the arrangement is called radial. In conjoint type of vascular bundles, the xylem and phloem are jointly situated along the same radius of vascular bundles. Such vascular bundles are common in stems and leaves. The conjoint vascular bundles usually have the phloem located only on the outer side of xylem.

6.2 ANATOMY OF DICOTYLEDONOUS AND MONOCOTYLEDONOUS PLANTS

6.2.1 Dicotyledonous Root

The outermost layer is epiblema. Many of the cells of epiblema protrude in the form of unicellular root hairs. The cortex consists of several layers of thin-walled parenchyma cells with intercellular spaces. The innermost layer of the cortex is called endodermis. It comprises a single layer of barrel-shaped cells without any intercellular spaces. The tangential as well as radial walls of the endodermal cells have a deposition of water-impermeable, waxy material suberin in the form of casparian strips. Next to endodermis lies a few layers of thick-walled parenchymatous cells referred to as pericycle. Initiation of lateral roots and vascular cambium during the secondary growth takes place in these cells. The pith is small or inconspicuous. The parenchymatous cells which lie between the xylem and the phloem are called conjunctive tissue. There are usually two to four xylem and phloem patches. Later, a cambium ring develops between the xylem and phloem. All tissues on the inner side of the endodermis such as pericycle, vascular bundles and pith constitute the stele.

6.2.2 Monocotyledonous Root

It has epidermis, cortex, endodermis, pericycle, vascular bundles and pith. As compared to the dicot root which has fewer xylem bundles, there are usually more than six xylem bundles in the monocot root. Pith is large and well developed. Monocotyledonous roots do not undergo any secondary growth.

6.2.3 Dicotyledonous Stem

The epidermis is the outermost protective layer of the stem. Covered with a thin layer of cuticle, it may bear trichomes and a few stomata. The cortex consists of three sub-zones. The outer hypodermis consists of a few layers of collenchymatous cells just below the epidermis, which provide mechanical strength to the young stem. Cortical layers below hypodermis consist of rounded thin-walled parenchymatous cells with conspicuous intercellular spaces. The innermost layer of the cortex is called the endodermis. The cells of the endodermis are rich in starch grains and the layer is also referred to as the starch sheath. Pericycle is present on the inner side of the endodermis and above the phloem in the form of semi-lunar patches of sclerenchyma. In between the vascular bundles there are a few layers of radially placed parenchymatous cells, which constitute medullary rays. A large number of vascular bundles are arranged in a ring. Each vascular bundle is conjoint, open and with endarch protoxylem. The central portion of the stem is occupied by large rounded parenchymatous cells with large intercellular spaces and is called the pith.

6.2.4 Monocotyledonous Stem

The monocot stem has a sclerenchymatous hypodermis, a large number of scattered vascular bundles each surrounded by a sclerenchymatous bundle sheath, and a large, conspicuous parenchymatous ground tissue. Vascular bundles are conjoint and closed. Peripheral vascular bundles are generally smaller than the centrally located ones. The phloem parenchyma is absent and water-containing cavities are present within the vascular bundles.

6.2.5 Dorsiventral (Dicotyledonous) Leaf

The epidermis covers both the upper surface (adaxial) and lower surface (abaxial) of the leaf and has a conspicuous cuticle. The abaxial epidermis generally bears more stomata than the adaxial epidermis. The tissue between the upper and the lower epidermis is called the mesophyll. Mesophyll is made up of chloroplast-containing parenchyma and has two types of cells – palisade parenchyma and spongy parenchyma. Palisade cells are elongated and arranged vertically. Spongy parenchyma is loosely arranged with air cavities. Vascular bundles are seen in the veins and midrib. The vascular bundles are surrounded by a layer of thick-walled bundle sheath cells.

6.2.6 Isobilateral (Monocotyledonous) Leaf

In an isobilateral leaf, the stomata are present on both surfaces. The mesophyll is not differentiated into palisade and spongy parenchyma. In grasses, some adaxial epidermal cells modify into bulliform cells. These help in rolling and unrolling of leaves under water stress. The vascular bundles are nearly similar in size and are arranged according to parallel venation.

SUMMARY

Anatomically, a plant is made of different kinds of tissues. The plant tissues are broadly classified into meristematic and permanent tissues. There are three tissue systems – epidermal, ground and vascular. The vascular bundles are of different types based on cambium presence and the arrangement of xylem and phloem. Monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants differ significantly in internal structure and vascular arrangement. Secondary growth occurs in most dicot roots and stems.

  title: "Structural Organisation in Animals",
  content: `
In the preceding chapters you came across a large variety of organisms, both unicellular and multicellular, of the animal kingdom. In unicellular organisms, all functions like digestion, respiration and reproduction are performed by a single cell. In the complex body of multicellular animals the same basic functions are carried out by different groups of cells in a well organised manner. The body of a simple organism like Hydra is made of different types of cells and the number of cells in each type can be in thousands. The human body is composed of billions of cells to perform various functions. In multicellular animals, a group of similar cells along with intercellular substances perform a specific function. Such an organisation is called tissue.

All complex animals consist of only four basic types of tissues. These tissues are organised in specific proportion and pattern to form an organ like stomach, lung, heart and kidney. When two or more organs perform a common function by their physical and/or chemical interaction, they together form organ systems, e.g., digestive system, respiratory system, etc. Cells, tissues, organs and organ systems split up the work in a way that exhibits division of labour and contribute to the survival of the body as a whole.

7.1 ORGAN AND ORGAN SYSTEM

The basic tissues organise to form organs which in turn associate to form organ systems in multicellular organisms. Such an organisation is essential for efficient and better coordinated activities. Each organ in our body is made of one or more types of tissues. For example, our heart consists of epithelial, connective, muscular and neural tissues. The complexity in organ and organ systems displays a discernable evolutionary trend. In this chapter, you are introduced to the morphology and anatomy of a frog representing vertebrates. Morphology refers to external appearance of the organs or parts of the body. Anatomy refers to the study of internal organs in animals.

7.2 FROGS

Frogs can live both on land and in freshwater and belong to class Amphibia of phylum Chordata. The most common species of frog found in India is Rana tigrina. They are cold-blooded animals, i.e., their body temperature varies with the environment. They exhibit camouflage by changing their colour. Frogs undergo aestivation during peak summer and hibernation during winter.

7.2.1 Morphology

The skin is smooth and slippery due to the presence of mucus. It is moist and helps in absorption of water. The dorsal side is olive green with dark spots and the ventral side is pale yellow. Body is divided into head and trunk. A neck and tail are absent. A pair of nostrils is present above the mouth. Eyes are bulged and protected by a nictitating membrane. Tympanum (ear) is present on either side of eyes. Forelimbs and hind limbs help in locomotion. Hind limbs are longer, muscular and have five webbed digits. Male frogs have vocal sacs and a copulatory pad on the first digit.

7.2.2 Anatomy

Frog’s body cavity contains digestive, circulatory, respiratory, nervous, excretory and reproductive systems. The digestive system includes alimentary canal and digestive glands. The alimentary canal consists of mouth, buccal cavity, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, intestine, rectum and cloaca. Liver secretes bile stored in gall bladder. Pancreas secretes pancreatic juice. Food is captured by the bilobed tongue. Digestion starts in the stomach. Chyme moves to duodenum where bile and pancreatic juices aid digestion. Final digestion occurs in the intestine. Nutrients are absorbed by villi and microvilli. Undigested food is passed to rectum and out through cloaca.

Frogs respire through skin in water (cutaneous respiration), and through buccal cavity, skin and lungs on land. Pulmonary respiration occurs via a pair of sac-like lungs. During aestivation and hibernation, respiration is entirely cutaneous.

The circulatory system is closed and includes heart, blood vessels and blood. Heart has three chambers and is covered by pericardium. Sinus venosus joins the right atrium and receives blood via vena cava. The ventricle leads to conus arteriosus. Blood is circulated through arteries and collected via veins. Hepatic and renal portal systems are present. Blood contains RBCs, WBCs and platelets. RBCs are nucleated. Lymph lacks RBCs and some proteins. Circulation is driven by the heart’s pumping action.

The excretory system includes a pair of kidneys, ureters, cloaca and urinary bladder. Kidneys are bean-shaped and composed of nephrons. Male ureters act as urinogenital ducts. In females, ureters and oviducts open separately into cloaca. Frog excretes urea and is ureotelic.

Control and coordination are managed by neural and endocrine systems. Endocrine glands include pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, thymus, pineal, pancreatic islets, adrenals and gonads. The nervous system includes central (brain and spinal cord), peripheral (nerves) and autonomic systems. Ten pairs of cranial nerves arise from the brain. The brain is enclosed in the cranium and divided into forebrain (olfactory lobes, cerebral hemispheres, diencephalon), midbrain (optic lobes) and hindbrain (cerebellum, medulla oblongata). Medulla continues into spinal cord.

Sense organs include sensory papillae (touch), taste buds, nasal epithelium (smell), eyes (vision), tympanum (hearing and balance). Eyes are simple and located in the skull’s orbits. External ear is absent.

Male reproductive system includes a pair of yellowish ovoid testes attached near kidneys by mesorchium. Vasa efferentia transport sperms to kidneys and then to cloaca. Female system includes a pair of ovaries near kidneys. Oviducts open into the cloaca separately. Fertilisation is external and occurs in water. Development includes a larval stage (tadpole) that undergoes metamorphosis.

Frogs are useful to humans by eating pests and maintaining ecological balance. In some countries, frog legs are consumed as food.

SUMMARY

Cells, tissues, organs and organ systems exhibit division of labour for body survival. A tissue is a group of cells performing one or more functions. Epithelia line body surfaces and cavities. The Indian bullfrog (Rana tigrina) has a moist skin that aids respiration. It has a muscular, bilobed tongue and a closed circulatory system. RBCs are nucleated. The nervous system has central, peripheral and autonomic divisions. Excretory system includes kidneys and ducts opening into the cloaca. Reproductive system involves testes in males and ovaries in females. Fertilisation and development are external. The eggs hatch into tadpoles that metamorphose into adult frogs.

When you look around, you see both living and non-living things. You must have wondered and asked yourself – what is it that makes an organism living, or what is it that an inanimate thing does not have which a living thing has? The answer to this is the presence of the basic unit of life – the cell in all living organisms.

All organisms are composed of cells. Some are composed of a single cell and are called unicellular organisms while others, like us, composed of many cells, are called multicellular organisms.

8.1 WHAT IS A CELL?

Unicellular organisms are capable of independent existence and performing the essential functions of life. Cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of all living organisms. Antonie Von Leeuwenhoek first saw and described a live cell. Robert Brown later discovered the nucleus. With the invention and advancement of the microscope, especially the electron microscope, the structural details of the cell were revealed.

8.2 CELL THEORY

Matthias Schleiden and Theodore Schwann proposed the cell theory. Schleiden observed that all plants are made of cells. Schwann concluded that all animals and plants are composed of cells and their products. Rudolf Virchow added that all cells arise from pre-existing cells. Thus, the modern cell theory states: (i) all living organisms are composed of cells and products of cells, and (ii) all cells arise from pre-existing cells.

8.3 AN OVERVIEW OF CELL

The onion cell has a distinct cell wall and membrane while human cheek cells have only the membrane. Both have a membrane-bound nucleus containing chromosomes and DNA. Eukaryotic cells have membrane-bound nuclei, while prokaryotic cells do not. The cytoplasm contains various organelles like ER, Golgi complex, mitochondria, lysosomes, vacuoles, etc., in eukaryotic cells. Ribosomes are found in both types of cells and are the sites of protein synthesis. Centrosomes help in cell division in animal cells. Cells vary greatly in size, shape and function.

8.4 PROKARYOTIC CELLS

Prokaryotes include bacteria, blue-green algae, mycoplasma and PPLO. They lack a membrane-bound nucleus and organelles. Genetic material is naked and circular. Plasmids are extra chromosomal DNA. Ribosomes are 70S. Cell envelope consists of glycocalyx, cell wall and plasma membrane. Flagella aid in movement. Pili and fimbriae help in attachment. Mesosomes assist in respiration, DNA replication and other processes. Inclusions like phosphate granules and gas vacuoles are storage sites.

8.5 EUKARYOTIC CELLS

Eukaryotic cells have a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. Plant cells have cell walls, plastids and large vacuoles. Animal cells have centrioles. The plasma membrane is a lipid bilayer with proteins. Singer and Nicolson proposed the fluid mosaic model. Transport across the membrane may be passive (diffusion, osmosis) or active (ATP-dependent).

8.5.2 Cell Wall

Found in plants and fungi. Provides rigidity and protection. Made of cellulose and other compounds. Middle lamella holds adjacent cells together. Plasmodesmata connect cytoplasm of neighboring cells.

8.5.3 Endomembrane System

Includes ER, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes and vacuoles. Functions are coordinated.

8.5.3.1 Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)

Rough ER has ribosomes and synthesises proteins. Smooth ER synthesises lipids and steroids.

8.5.3.2 Golgi Apparatus

Discovered by Camillo Golgi. Processes and packages materials. Forms glycoproteins and glycolipids.

8.5.3.3 Lysosomes

Contain hydrolytic enzymes. Digest macromolecules.

8.5.3.4 Vacuoles

Membrane-bound compartments storing water, waste and other substances. Plant vacuoles maintain cell turgidity. Amoeba has contractile vacuole for osmoregulation.

8.5.4 Mitochondria

Double-membrane bound organelles. Inner membrane forms cristae. Site of ATP production. Contains its own DNA and 70S ribosomes. Known as the powerhouse of the cell.

8.5.5 Plastids

Found in plant cells. Chloroplasts (photosynthesis), chromoplasts (pigments), leucoplasts (storage). Chloroplasts have grana (thylakoid stacks), stroma and own DNA and ribosomes.

8.5.6 Ribosomes

Non-membrane bound organelles made of RNA and proteins. Eukaryotic (80S) and prokaryotic (70S) types. Site of protein synthesis.

8.5.7 Cytoskeleton

Network of microtubules, microfilaments and intermediate filaments. Provides mechanical support, shape and motility.

8.5.8 Cilia and Flagella

Hair-like projections aiding in movement. Structure has 9+2 arrangement of microtubules. Emerge from basal bodies.

8.5.9 Centrosome and Centrioles

Present in animal cells. Each centrosome has two centrioles arranged perpendicularly. Help in spindle formation during cell division.

8.5.10 Nucleus

Discovered by Robert Brown. Enclosed by nuclear envelope with pores. Contains nucleoplasm, chromatin and nucleolus. Nucleolus synthesises rRNA. Chromatin condenses into chromosomes during cell division. Chromosomes have centromere and kinetochore. Types of chromosomes: metacentric, sub-metacentric, acrocentric, telocentric.

8.5.11 Microbodies

Membrane-bound vesicles with enzymes, present in both plant and animal cells.

SUMMARY

All organisms are made of cells or their aggregates. Cells vary in shape, size and function. Based on the presence of nucleus, cells are prokaryotic or eukaryotic. A eukaryotic cell has plasma membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus. Plant cells have a cell wall and plastids. Cell membrane controls movement of substances. ER transports and synthesises proteins and lipids. Golgi apparatus modifies and packages materials. Lysosomes digest macromolecules. Ribosomes synthesise proteins. Mitochondria generate energy. Plastids trap light and store nutrients. Nucleus controls cell functions and heredity. Thus, the cell is the structural and functional unit of life.

There is a wide diversity in living organisms in our biosphere. All organisms, whether plant, animal or microbe, contain the same elements—such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, etc.—though their abundance differs from non-living matter. Carbon and hydrogen are found in relatively higher abundance in living organisms.

9.1 HOW TO ANALYSE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION?

By grinding living tissue in trichloroacetic acid and filtering it, we get two fractions: acid-soluble (micromolecules) and acid-insoluble (macromolecules). Acid-soluble compounds are small with molecular weights between 18-800 daltons and include amino acids, sugars, fatty acids, nucleotides, etc. Acid-insoluble compounds are proteins, polysaccharides, nucleic acids and lipids. Though lipids are small, they are part of membrane structures and get separated as acid-insoluble.

Amino acids are α-amino acids with a variable R group. Based on R group, amino acids can be acidic, basic, neutral or aromatic. There are 20 amino acids in proteins. Lipids are fatty acids esterified with glycerol, may be saturated or unsaturated, and may also contain phosphorus (phospholipids). Nucleotides are composed of a nitrogen base, sugar (ribose/deoxyribose), and phosphate. Nucleosides are nucleotides without phosphate.

9.2 PRIMARY AND SECONDARY METABOLITES

Primary metabolites are compounds like amino acids, sugars, lipids, etc., essential for normal physiological functions. Secondary metabolites (alkaloids, flavonoids, essential oils, pigments, etc.) are found mainly in plants, fungi and microbes and may have ecological roles or uses in human welfare.

9.3 BIOMACROMOLECULES

Macromolecules are polymeric substances of high molecular weight found in the acid-insoluble fraction—proteins, nucleic acids, and polysaccharides. Lipids, although small, are found here due to membrane association. Water is the most abundant component in living cells.

9.4 PROTEINS

Proteins are heteropolymers of amino acids joined by peptide bonds. They serve structural, enzymatic, hormonal, and immune functions. Collagen is the most abundant animal protein. RuBisCO is the most abundant protein in the biosphere.

9.5 POLYSACCHARIDES

Polysaccharides are long chains of monosaccharides. Cellulose is a homopolymer of glucose found in plant cell walls. Starch (in plants) and glycogen (in animals) are energy storage polysaccharides. Chitin is a polysaccharide found in arthropod exoskeletons.

9.6 NUCLEIC ACIDS

DNA and RNA are polynucleotides. Each nucleotide has a nitrogenous base (adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine or uracil), a sugar (ribose or deoxyribose), and a phosphate group. DNA contains deoxyribose; RNA contains ribose.

9.7 STRUCTURE OF PROTEINS

Protein structure is described at four levels:

- Primary: Sequence of amino acids.
- Secondary: Local folding into helices or sheets.
- Tertiary: 3D folding essential for biological function.
- Quaternary: Assembly of multiple polypeptides (e.g., hemoglobin has 4 subunits).

9.8 ENZYMES

Enzymes are protein catalysts that speed up biochemical reactions. Ribozymes are RNA molecules with catalytic activity.

9.8.1 Chemical Reactions

Chemical reactions involve breaking and forming of bonds. Enzymes like carbonic anhydrase can increase the rate of reactions by millions of times. A pathway like glucose → pyruvic acid involves multiple enzyme-catalyzed steps.

9.8.2 Enzyme Mechanism

Enzymes have an active site where substrates bind, forming an enzyme-substrate complex. This leads to formation of products. Enzymes reduce activation energy and increase reaction rate.

9.8.3 Nature of Enzyme Action

Enzymes form short-lived complexes:  
E + S → ES → EP → E + P

9.8.4 Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity

Enzyme activity depends on temperature, pH, and substrate concentration. Optimal values exist for each enzyme. High temperatures denature enzymes. Enzyme activity may be inhibited by chemicals like competitive inhibitors (e.g., malonate inhibits succinic dehydrogenase).

9.8.5 Enzyme Classification

Enzymes are classified into six classes:

1. Oxidoreductases
2. Transferases
3. Hydrolases
4. Lyases
5. Isomerases
6. Ligases

9.8.6 Cofactors

Cofactors are non-protein parts needed for enzyme activity. They may be:

- Prosthetic groups (tightly bound, e.g., haem),
- Co-enzymes (loosely bound, often derived from vitamins, e.g., NAD, NADP),
- Metal ions (e.g., Zn²⁺ in carboxypeptidase).

Without cofactors, enzymes lose their catalytic ability.

SUMMARY

Despite the diversity of life, chemical composition and metabolism are similar. Living matter contains water, micromolecules (amino acids, sugars, nucleotides, etc.), and macromolecules (proteins, polysaccharides, nucleic acids). Proteins perform structural and functional roles. Enzymes catalyse specific reactions by lowering activation energy. They require optimal temperature, pH, and sometimes cofactors. Nucleic acids store genetic information. Polysaccharides provide energy storage and structural support. The molecular organization of life is remarkably systematic and efficient.

  title: "Cell Cycle and Cell Division",
  content: `
All organisms, from the simplest unicellular to the most complex multicellular ones, begin life from a single cell. This cell grows and divides, forming new cells that in turn grow and divide. This continuous process of growth and division enables the development of large organisms from a single cell. Cell division is fundamental to growth, reproduction, tissue repair, and maintenance.

10.1 CELL CYCLE

The cell cycle is the sequence of events through which a cell passes from one division to the next. It includes phases of growth, DNA replication, and cell division. A typical eukaryotic cell cycle is divided into two main phases: Interphase and the M phase (mitotic phase). Interphase is further divided into three sub-phases: G1 (Gap 1), S (Synthesis), and G2 (Gap 2).

- G1 Phase: The cell is metabolically active, grows in size, and prepares for DNA replication but does not replicate DNA yet.
- S Phase: DNA replication takes place. The amount of DNA doubles but the chromosome number remains unchanged.
- G2 Phase: The cell prepares for mitosis by synthesizing proteins and other materials.

Some cells exit the cycle and enter a quiescent stage (G0) where they are metabolically active but do not divide, unless triggered by physiological signals.

10.2 M PHASE (MITOSIS)

Mitosis is the actual process of cell division and is also known as equational division because it maintains the chromosome number in the daughter cells. Mitosis is divided into the following stages:

10.2.1 Prophase

Prophase marks the beginning of mitosis. Chromatin condenses to form visible chromosomes. Each chromosome has two sister chromatids joined at a centromere. The centrosomes move to opposite poles forming spindle fibres and asters. The nucleolus and nuclear envelope disappear.

10.2.2 Metaphase

Chromosomes align along the equatorial plate (metaphase plate). Spindle fibres attach to the kinetochores of chromosomes, ensuring each chromatid is connected to opposite poles.

10.2.3 Anaphase

Centromeres split and sister chromatids are pulled to opposite poles by spindle fibres. These separated chromatids are now referred to as daughter chromosomes.

10.2.4 Telophase

The daughter chromosomes reach the poles and begin to decondense. The nuclear envelope reforms around each set of chromosomes, and the nucleolus reappears. This marks the end of karyokinesis.

10.2.5 Cytokinesis

Cytokinesis divides the cytoplasm, forming two daughter cells. In animal cells, it occurs via cleavage furrow formation, while in plant cells, a cell plate forms, eventually becoming the new cell wall.

10.3 SIGNIFICANCE OF MITOSIS

Mitosis plays a critical role in:

- Growth and development of multicellular organisms.
- Repair and regeneration of tissues (e.g., skin, blood cells).
- Maintaining genetic stability by producing identical daughter cells.
- Vegetative reproduction in plants.

Mitosis ensures the nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio is balanced during growth and contributes to the continuous development of plant organs via meristematic activity.

10.4 MEIOSIS

Meiosis is a specialised type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, producing haploid gametes from diploid cells. It is essential for maintaining the species-specific chromosome number across generations and for introducing genetic variation.

Meiosis includes two successive divisions: Meiosis I and Meiosis II.

10.4.1 MEIOSIS I

Prophase I: The longest phase of meiosis, subdivided into:
- Leptotene: Chromosomes become visible.
- Zygotene: Homologous chromosomes pair up (synapsis) forming bivalents.
- Pachytene: Crossing over occurs between non-sister chromatids, mediated by recombinase enzyme.
- Diplotene: Synaptonemal complex dissolves, and chiasmata become visible.
- Diakinesis: Chromosomes are fully condensed; spindle apparatus begins to form.

Metaphase I: Bivalents align at the equatorial plate, spindle fibres attach to homologous chromosomes.

Anaphase I: Homologous chromosomes are pulled to opposite poles. Sister chromatids remain attached at the centromeres.

Telophase I: Nuclear membranes reform around haploid chromosome sets. Cytokinesis follows, forming two haploid cells (dyads).

10.4.2 MEIOSIS II

Prophase II: Chromosomes condense again. Nuclear envelope dissolves.

Metaphase II: Chromosomes align at the equator. Spindle fibres attach to kinetochores.

Anaphase II: Centromeres split and sister chromatids move to opposite poles.

Telophase II: Chromatids decondense, nuclear envelope reforms, and cytokinesis results in four haploid daughter cells (tetrad).

10.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF MEIOSIS

- Meiosis maintains the chromosome number across generations in sexually reproducing organisms.
- It introduces genetic variation through crossing over and independent assortment of chromosomes.
- This variation is essential for evolution and adaptation in populations.

SUMMARY

The cell cycle is a carefully regulated sequence of growth, replication, and division. It consists of interphase (G1, S, G2) and M phase (mitosis or meiosis). Mitosis produces two genetically identical diploid cells, essential for growth and repair. Meiosis, in contrast, involves two successive divisions resulting in four genetically diverse haploid cells. It ensures genetic continuity and variation, both of which are vital for evolution and reproduction.

  title: "Photosynthesis in Higher Plants",
  content: `
Green plants are autotrophs that synthesize their own food through photosynthesis, a physico-chemical process that uses sunlight to produce glucose from carbon dioxide and water. This process is essential for life on Earth, not only as the source of food for all heterotrophs but also as the source of atmospheric oxygen.

11.1 WHAT DO WE KNOW?

Photosynthesis requires chlorophyll, light, and carbon dioxide. Simple experiments like covering parts of a leaf or using CO₂-absorbing chemicals such as KOH demonstrate that only green leaf areas exposed to light perform photosynthesis.

11.2 EARLY EXPERIMENTS

Joseph Priestley showed that plants restore air fouled by burning candles or animals. Jan Ingenhousz proved that sunlight is essential, and only green parts of plants release oxygen. Julius von Sachs confirmed that glucose is synthesized in chloroplasts and stored as starch. T.W. Engelmann used aerobic bacteria and a prism to determine that photosynthesis is most active in blue and red light. Cornelius van Niel clarified that oxygen released in photosynthesis comes from water, not CO₂.

11.3 WHERE DOES PHOTOSYNTHESIS TAKE PLACE?

Photosynthesis occurs mainly in green leaves, especially in the chloroplast-rich mesophyll cells. The chloroplast contains grana (light reaction site) and stroma (site for sugar synthesis). Light reactions produce ATP and NADPH, while dark reactions (Calvin cycle) use these products to fix CO₂.

11.4 HOW MANY TYPES OF PIGMENTS ARE INVOLVED?

Chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, xanthophylls, and carotenoids are involved. Chlorophyll a is the chief pigment. Accessory pigments absorb additional wavelengths and protect chlorophyll a from damage.

11.5 WHAT IS LIGHT REACTION?

Light reactions involve:
- Light absorption
- Water splitting
- Oxygen release
- Formation of ATP and NADPH

Two photosystems exist:
- Photosystem I (P700)
- Photosystem II (P680)

Pigments form light-harvesting complexes. Chlorophyll a in the reaction centre gets excited and initiates electron transport.

11.6 THE ELECTRON TRANSPORT

The Z-scheme illustrates electron flow from PSII to PSI and ultimately to NADP⁺ to form NADPH. Water-splitting at PSII provides electrons, releasing O₂. ATP is synthesized via chemiosmosis as a proton gradient is formed across the thylakoid membrane and drives ATP synthase.

11.6.1 Splitting of Water

Water is split at PSII to provide electrons and release oxygen.

11.6.2 Cyclic and Non-cyclic Photophosphorylation

- Non-cyclic: Involves both PSII and PSI, produces ATP and NADPH.
- Cyclic: Only PSI involved; produces only ATP, no NADPH or O₂.

11.6.3 Chemiosmotic Hypothesis

Protons accumulate in the thylakoid lumen. Their movement back to the stroma through ATP synthase releases energy to synthesize ATP.

11.7 WHERE ARE THE ATP AND NADPH USED?

ATP and NADPH from the light reaction are used in the biosynthetic phase (Calvin cycle) to fix CO₂ into sugars. Melvin Calvin traced the steps using radioactive CO₂ and discovered the 3-carbon product, PGA, as the first stable product.

11.7.1 The Primary Acceptor of CO₂

The CO₂ acceptor is a 5-carbon compound called RuBP. The enzyme RuBisCO catalyzes CO₂ fixation.

11.7.2 The Calvin Cycle

Three stages:
1. Carboxylation: CO₂ + RuBP → 2 PGA (via RuBisCO)
2. Reduction: PGA → glucose (using ATP and NADPH)
3. Regeneration: RuBP regenerated using ATP

To form one glucose molecule, 6 CO₂, 18 ATP, and 12 NADPH are required.

11.8 THE C4 PATHWAY

C4 plants (e.g., maize, sorghum) have specialized 'Kranz' anatomy. The first CO₂ fixation product is oxaloacetic acid (4-carbon). Fixation occurs in mesophyll cells using PEP carboxylase. CO₂ is released in bundle sheath cells and enters Calvin cycle. C4 plants are more efficient in hot, dry climates and have no photorespiration.

11.9 PHOTORESPIRATION

In C3 plants, RuBisCO can bind to both CO₂ and O₂. When O₂ binds, photorespiration occurs, producing phosphoglycolate, which does not yield ATP or sugars and wastes energy. C4 plants concentrate CO₂ in bundle sheath cells, minimizing RuBisCO’s oxygenase activity.

11.10 FACTORS AFFECTING PHOTOSYNTHESIS

Photosynthesis is influenced by internal (leaf anatomy, chloroplast number) and external (light, CO₂, temperature, water) factors.

11.10.1 Light

Photosynthesis increases with light intensity but saturates at 10% of full sunlight. Excessive light can damage chlorophyll.

11.10.2 Carbon Dioxide

CO₂ is a limiting factor. C3 plants respond to elevated CO₂ by increasing photosynthesis, unlike C4 plants which saturate earlier.

11.10.3 Temperature

C4 plants prefer higher temperatures. Temperature optimum varies with plant habitat.

11.10.4 Water

Water indirectly affects photosynthesis by influencing stomatal closure and leaf wilting.

SUMMARY

Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants synthesize food using sunlight, CO₂, and water. It occurs in two phases:
- Light reactions (in grana): produce ATP, NADPH, release O₂
- Dark reactions (in stroma): fix CO₂ to form sugars via Calvin cycle

C3 plants use RuBP as the CO₂ acceptor and form PGA as the first product. C4 plants initially fix CO₂ into OAA and show Kranz anatomy. They are more efficient and avoid photorespiration. Photosynthesis is influenced by multiple environmental and internal factors.
